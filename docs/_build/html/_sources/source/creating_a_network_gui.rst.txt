Network Instantiation
*********************

Networks are created from the network manager page. Networks can either be created from a template or from scratch using
the cytoscape network editor.


Template
---------
Template networks are created by choosing a named layout representing a certain
network topology and a series of configurable parameters dependent on that topology.

Launch the *Template network creator* by clicking the *Template network* button on the *Network management* page.

Node editor
------------
Networks can be created from scratch in the network editor by manually adding nodes and edges.
When the network is updated the changes will automatically be saved to the network in the database.

Launch the *Node editor* by clicking the *Custom network* button on the *Network management* page.
